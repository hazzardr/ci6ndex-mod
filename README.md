* [Gueux](https://forums.civfanatics.com/members/gueux.309829/) of Civfanatics, who I pulled a ton of inspiration from their [ReplayButton](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/replay-button.638174/page-4#post-16025162) mod
* [isau](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/tutorial-modding-with-sqllite-studio-pc.608352/), also from Civfanatics, who provided a guide on how to mod without using ModBuddy
